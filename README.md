<p>
  I solve cloud, DevOps and machine-learning problems by building reliable automation, scalable infrastructure and observability so teams ship faster with less risk. I focus on practical solutions: pipeline reliability, repeatable infra, and measurable monitoring — all driven by continuous learning and real-world results.
</p>
<h2>TECH STACK — Tools I use daily</h2>
<h3>Cloud & Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
  AWS (core services: EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda) — EKS clusters, CloudFormation, cost-aware design
</p>
<h3>Infrastructure as Code & Orchestration</h3>
<p>Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes (K8s), Helm, EKS</p>
<h3>CI/CD & Quality</h3>
<p>Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipeline design (code → build → test → deploy)

SonarQube for static analysis and quality gates</p>
<h3>Monitoring & Observability</h3>
<p>Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards), alerting and SLO/SLI practices</p>
<h3>Development & ML</h3>
<p>Python (scripting, automation, ML prototyping), basic ML tooling and data workstreams</p>
<h3>Source Control</h3>
<p>Git, GitHub — branching strategies, PR reviews, release tagging</p>
<h1>Soft skills</h1>
<p>Problem solving: break complex system failures into fixable steps and permanent mitigations

Clear communicator: translate technical tradeoffs for engineers and stakeholders

Ownership: ship end-to-end solutions and follow through on operational improvements

Fast learner: pick up new cloud services and tools, validate with small experiments

Collaboration

Automate repeatable tasks; treat manual steps as technical debt.

Test and validate on small scale before rolling wide.

Build observability first: if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.

Prioritize security and cost-efficiency alongside reliability.</p>
